# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.

| Version | Supported          |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Do not create a new issue ticket with the detailed information of the vulnerability under any circumstances!

All vulnerabilities can be reported directly to the main project maintainers (currently @frankfommers and @vytautask) directly
 via email (frank-hfpg[at]hommers[dot]nl or vytautaskasp[at]gmail[dot]com respectively). We should get back to you in 24 hours. Please include as much information as possible (if you have a POC - even better). All security issues have our highest attention and will be solved ASAP. 
 
You would help us out if you also include a fix in a pull request. That way we can quickly release a fix.

Thank you for your understanding.
